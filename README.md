## Introduction

This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide for beginners to understand and master the basics of Python programming. Each section contains explanations, code examples, and exercises to help reinforce your understanding of the concepts.

## Python Data Types

Python supports various data types that are used to define the operations possible on them and the storage method for each of them. Here are some of the primary data types:

- **Integers**
- **Floats**
- **Strings**
- **Booleans**

For more details, refer to the [Data Types Tutorial](tutorials/data_types.md).

## Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow you to execute code based on certain conditions. The primary conditional statements in Python are:

- `if` statement
- `if-else` statement
- `if-elif-else` statement

For more details, refer to the [Conditional Statements Tutorial](tutorials/conditional_statements.md).

## Loops

Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. Python provides the following types of loops:

- `for` loop
- `while` loop

For more details, refer to the [Loops Tutorial](tutorials/loops.md).

## Python Lists

Lists are ordered collections of items that can be of different types. Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed.

For more details, refer to the [Lists Tutorial](tutorials/lists.md).

## Python Sets

Sets are unordered collections of unique items. Sets are useful for storing items where duplicates are not allowed.

For more details, refer to the [Sets Tutorial](tutorials/sets.md).

## Python Tuples

Tuples are ordered collections of items that cannot be changed (immutable). They are similar to lists but have the key difference of being immutable.

For more details, refer to the [Tuples Tutorial](tutorials/tuples.md).

## Python Dictionaries

Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs. Each key is unique, and values can be accessed using their corresponding keys.

For more details, refer to the [Dictionaries Tutorial](tutorials/dictionaries.md).

## Object-Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which contain data and methods. Key concepts of OOP include:

- **Classes and Objects**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Encapsulation**

For more details, refer to the [Object-Oriented Programming Tutorial](tutorials/oop.md).
